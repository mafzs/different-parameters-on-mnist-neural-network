# different-parameters-on-mnist-neural-network
we check different hyperparameters such as epoch depth and number of neurons in each layer on the performance of neural network.at first i generate a neural network and train it 
on mnist dataset after this i examine effect of different hyperparameters on the model accyracy and performance and plot ideas that i generat.
